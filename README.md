This is a group project for our computer graphics class which required us to learn openGL and have the given features:
- Create a flat plane that is organized in a 10x10 grid which spans across the X/Z coords
- Create traversable roads with boundaries
- Create 5 different building types that are more than a single prism and at least 20 buildings across the plane 
- Create functioning traffic lights that cycle between colours and have at least 5 across the plane
- Create a car that is more than a single prism that has wheels that rotate properly
- Create 3 different camera angles
    -> Perspective view from behind the car (3rd person)
    -> Othrographic view from directly above the car (topDown)
    -> Perspective view facing the side of the car (sideView)
